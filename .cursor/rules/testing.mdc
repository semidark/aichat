# Overview: Kindle AI Chat Testing Guide

`docs/testing.md` developers set up and run tests for the Kindle AI Chat project. It covers:

- **Test setup:** How to run and watch tests using Rust tools.
- **Testing patterns:** Examples for unit, async, streaming, and integration tests (for web endpoints).
- **What to test:** Priorities include core chat logic, Kindle-specific performance, and HTTP endpoints via integration tests.
- **How to run/debug tests:** Commands, pre-commit checks, and troubleshooting tips.
- **Utilities:** Custom macros and helpers for easier testing.
- **Manual verification:** How and when to use curl to test real HTTP behavior beyond automated tests.

Use `docs/testing.md` as a reference for where and how to test Kindle AI Chat features.
